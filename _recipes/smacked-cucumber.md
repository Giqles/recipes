title:  "Smacked Cucumber Salad"
# image: sausage-pasta.jpg
tags: cucumber, chili, coriander, sesame
ingredients:
- 1 large cucumber
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1/2 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon chiu chow chili oil
- a handful of chopped coriander
- 2 spring onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (optional)
instructions:
- Rinse the cucumber and pat dry.
- Lay the cucumber on a cutting board and use a rolling pin to smack the cucumber until it starts to crack and flatten.
- Once the cucumber is smashed, chop it into bite-sized pieces. Transfer the pieces to a colander, sprinkle with salt, and toss to combine. Let the cucumber drain for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the salt to draw out some of the excess moisture.
- In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and chili oil. Stir well to dissolve the sugar and create a dressing.
- After the cucumber has drained, transfer them to a serving bowl. Pour the dressing over the cucumbers and toss to coat them evenly.
- Top the cucumber salad with coriander, sliced spring onions, and toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately or chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour to let the flavors meld.
